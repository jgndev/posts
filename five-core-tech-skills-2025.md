# Learn These 5 Core Tech Skills in 2025 to Skyrocket Your Career

There are five core skills that are the backbone of tech. Linux, Networking, Containers, Python and Web Servers.

All of these can be learned in your homelab and doing so you'll pick up the skills that will set you up for success in 
any role you might be interested in.

The best part is you can master all of these in a super simple homelab using what you probably already have.
Let’s break down why these skills are non-negotiable and how to get started for free in 2025.

## Why These 5 Core Skills Matter

You might even be asking *why these specific 5 skills* and not something else like AI, Kubernetes or that new tool that
everyone is talking about on popular Youtube channels.

If you have a solid grasp on Linux, Networking, Containers, Python and Web Servers you will have the most important
fundamentals and can go confidently and easily in any direction you want. These skills compliment each other so well 
they become a superpower when used together. 

You need at least a working knowledge of all five, but I recommend learning at least three to an advanced level. 
For example if you were a wizard with Linux, Python and Networking and competent wth Containers and Web Servers you
are set up for success in many roles in tech and can pick the thing you are most interested in with a rock solid foundation.

Having a skill gap in these five skills is going to be expensive eventually. As we'll cover below, they are everywhere
and usually found working together in a more complex system.


## 1. Linux: The Operating System That Runs the World

Linux powers so much of the world from servers to cloud platforms to IoT devices. Just about every app, service, or piece of tech
that is connected to a network that you have used or heard about is running Linux or a close cousin (Unix).

As we will talk about soon, Containers are another core skill you need to learn and Linux is *the* platform for that.

- **Why It Matters**: Being comfortable on a Linux machine is essential. It feels great to go blazing fast on a Linux machine
knowing exactly what is going on and what you are doing.
- **Get Started**: Install [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com) on an old laptop, virtual machine or whatever you have available
and learn how to use the system for normal things. As you get comfortable start learning to configure and customize it.

## 2. Networking: Connecting the World

Networking is the tech that makes it all work. Linux and Networking go together so it makes sense to understand how all
these servers running the world's tech connect and talk to each other.

- **Why It Matters**: A good grasp of Networking is required for most tech roles from junior roles to platform engineering wizards building clouds.
- **Get Started**: Use your home lab to learn how IPv4, Subnets, TCP/IP, UDP, Firewalls and DNS work. 

## 3. Containers: The Future of Software Deployment

Containers are a technology that is made possible by features of the Linux kernel. We use Containers because we can share
a fully working application that behaves the same everywhere, starts in seconds (or less) and greatly simplifies deployment.

- **Why It Matters**: Containers power many modern apps you probably use all time behind the scenes, possibly on a Kubernetes cluster.
- **Get Started**: Install Docker, Podman or Rancher Desktop in your Homelab and learn to run *and* build containers.

## 4. Python: The Swiss Army Knife of Programming

Python is everywhere. Automation, Infrastructure as Code, Artificial Intelligence, Data Engineering, Analytics, Web Development,
Package Managers, Networking tools, Cybersecurity tools, and much more. It is beginner-friendly yet powerful and a great
place to start building cool stuff.

- **Why It Matters**: Automating tasks with Python scripts saves time and looks great on a resume. It’s a must for DevOps and platform engineering roles.
- **Get Started**: Write a simple Python script in your homelab to automate a task, like backing up files or pinging a server. Try it in 1 hour with a free code editor like VS Code. Then, level up with a script to monitor your homelab’s CPU usage.

## 5. Web Servers: The Heart of the Internet

Linux runs the world because it runs the world's Web Servers, and not just obvious things like websites. Many services 
including major cloud providers are Linux, Networking, Containers, Software and Web Servers when distilled down to their core components.

Understanding Web Servers well unlocks several key roles in tech like Developer, Cloud, DevOps, Cybersecurity, Platform Engineer and more.

- **Why It Matters**: Web servers are critical for network connected apps and services, and knowing how they work is a key skill.
- **Get Started**: Install Nginx on your homelab and start learning the different things that web servers are used for in addition to hosting websites.

## How to Learn These Skills in Your Homelab on a Budget

I recommend that you get started with free tools like Docker, Rancher Desktop, Virtual Box and similar for free.
You don't need to spend any money to learn these skills. Spending on Cloud services or hardware for your homelab is
optional and if you are getting started you don't need anything but a Virtual Machine running Ubuntu and maybe Docker.

Try this beginner project for example:

- Install Ubuntu
- Run Nginx in a Docker container
- Write a Python script to check the status of the container
- Learn how to expose the Nginx container on your home network so you can ping it from another computer


## Tips for Learning the 5 Core Skills

- **Start small**: Start with Linux and get comfortable with it. You can learn the other four in parallel with small projects since they fit together remarkably well.
- **Failure is where the learning happens**: Embrace things not working and learn how to fix them. Whenever something takes extra effort to get working understand you are probably learning a lot more than if it just worked.
- **Error messages are your friend**: Develop the rare skill of reading error messages and trying to understand what it is telling you. Hours of time can be saved by just reading an error message, twice if needed.
- **Document as you go**: Keep notes on your homelab experiments in a GitHub repo to troubleshoot and as reference material for your portfolio.

## Conclusion

Learning Linux, Networking, Containers, Python, and Web Servers in your homelab is your ticket to a thriving tech career in 2025. 
These core skills open doors to many tech roles including Cloud, DevOps, Cybersecurity, and Development, all while letting you experiment on a budget.
